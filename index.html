    <div id="infodiv"><p id="info">Fractal Space PC is a whole new game, based of it's original version, Fractal Space Pocket Edition. It's in development for almost 3 years now! And it also gave some great things, like Intro, Upgrading, better History and Lore, and many, many more! FSPC's community also grew from that time, giving us such persons as Chris Lorentz Perez, a man who reported almost 800 bugs, author of this website, Wilbur Gray, who made modding real (with help of PNG Master, hehe, I won't forget you!), and Promidius, who made community server for chatting!<br>This site was made to see, how much time has past after first version of FSPC gone public, but also to thanks Charles for such great masterpiece! If you want to thanks him too, you can buy the game on release, or tweet your story about meeting the game with hashtag "ThankYouCharles"! </p></div>
